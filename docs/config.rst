Qiskit-Neko Configuration Files
===============================

To support running against different backends and also tune the execute of
tests qiskit-neko supports configuration files to tweak the configuration
and make reproducible testing simpler. The format for qiskit-neko's
configuration is a `yaml <https://yaml.org/>`_ file, a fully populated example
is below:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    test_timeout: 60.0
    backend_plugin: ibmq
    backend_selection: santiago
    backend_script: /tmp/backend_script
    default_log_level: DEBUG
    module_log_level:
        qiskit: INFO
        numpy: WARNING
    log_format: "%(asctime)s %(process)d [%(name)s] %(message)s"
    log_file: /tmp/qiskit_neko.log

The options are defined as below:

* ``test_timeout`` - A float value in seconds for the maximum per test timeout
  value. If a test takes longer than this value in seconds it will be marked
  as error/failed and the rest of the suite will run
* ``backend_plugin`` - A string value that takes in the plugin name to use for
  backends.  If this is not specified the backend plugin will default to the
  included :class:`.AerPlugin` class.
* ``backend_selection`` - An selection string that will be passed to the
  configured plugin and will be used to influence the returned backend from the
  backend. Refer to the plugin documentation for how this can be used as the
  exact behavior will be based on the plugin in use.
* ``backend_script`` - An optional absolute path to a script file to run in lieu
  of a plugin. This script file will be imported from this configured path.
  It must contain a function in the script named ``main()`` which when called
  returns a :class:`qiskit_neko.backend_plugin.BackendPlugin` subclass object
  that can be used for the tests. If this option is specified it will take
  precedence over ``backend_plugin``.
* ``default_log_level`` - The default log level to use for all modules emitting
  log messages during the test run. This can be any valid predefined log level,
  see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels for the
  complete list.
* ``module_log_level`` - this can be optionally set to a nested yaml dictionary
  where the keys are the module name and the value is the log level to use for
  that module. Just as with the ``default_log_level`` the values can be any
  valid predefined log leve,
  see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels for the
  complete list.
* ``log_format`` - An optional log format string to control the output format
  for log messages. This uses the same format as
  `logging.Formatter <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#formatter-objects>`__
  which is a `printf-style string <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting>`__
  that uses the built-in
  `LogRecord attributes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes>`__
* ``log_file`` - An optional file path that will be used to write all log messages
  to in addition to the default logging stored in the results stream all log
  messages emitted by the test run will be written to this file.

Specifying Configuration Files
------------------------------

By default the the configuration file for qiskit-neko is looked for in 4 places
in the following order. If a file is found in that location it will be used and
none of the subsequent locations will be checked:

#. ``$CWD/neko_config.yml``
#. ``~/.qiskit/neko_config.yml``
#. ``~/.config/qiskit-neko/neko_config.yml``
#. ``/etc/neko_config.yml``

Since the actual execution of tests is handled by the external Python standard
library `unittest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_ framework
the only mechanism to explicitly specify a configuration file path is with an
environment variable. You can set the environment variable ``NekoConfigPath`` to
the absolute path to the configuration file. If this is specified it will be
used regardless of a file being present in any of the default file locations.
